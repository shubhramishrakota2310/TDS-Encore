		<li class="current"><p>Hola ! <br> 
			We're Encore, otherwise formally known as ETDS - English Technology Dramatics Society. <br>
			We're the crux of all the quality theatrics that goes on in IIT Kharagpur, or you could say, we eat, breathe, act repeat ! <br>
			
			But that's not all, we boast of a huge alumni network, one better than the other, and are VERY close knit. All of us here at Encore are very well versed with all forms and styles of putting up a production on the stage, and actively put up a lot of different forms of Dramatics throughout the year.
			
			</p>
<p class="post-script">Stage humare BAAP ka hai!</p>
</li>
		
				
		<li ><p>We compete in all Stage Play events that we get to know of, and do Street Plays as well (come see us at SpringFest, IIT Kharagpur every year !). The institute owes a lot of its cultural laurels to the society, as we have been establishing our way through the Annual Inter IIT Cultural Meets as well.
		</p>
<p class="post-script">To be ~or not to be~</p>
</li>
		
				
		<li ><p>Being a part of Encore has innumerable number of perks - you get to make a host of new friends, across all the years without any hierarchy, you learn and enrich your acting skills, and even learn to write for the stage, along with direction. We're a society, dedicated to the stage, out and out, and hence we encourage other people who want to pursue dramatics and help them do so.

	<h1>EVENTS</h1>

		<li>
			<h2>STAGE PLAY</h2>
			<p>Each year, when our freshers debut on stage, under the guidance of their governors, it sure is a spectacle to see in IIT Kharagpur, along with the Rangmanch, which takes place during SpringFest, built with the contributions of the entire society.
				The toughest stage plays are the ones where we bid farewell to our graduating batch, every year. The annual production, they call it, leaving us a batch less, every year. 
				</p>
		</li>
		
				
		<li>
			<h2>STREET PLAY</h2>
			<p>Every year, the Encore freshers get an opportunity to put up a street play during SpringFest, IIT Kharagpur, and boy, do they do a good job at that. The endless number of winter nights they spend, deliberating and debating over the topics and the roles, is no joke. 
			</p>
		</li>
		
			
		<li>
			<h2>IMPROV</h2>
			<p>Getting bored? Tired of rehearsing the same scene for hours, even though it's not you who's missing the cue? Ah, let's have a round of improv. <br>
				The society houses a number of people who are experts at thinking on their feet, and what's more, they love tickling your funny bone !
				</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h2>MIME</h2>
			<p>The long lost art which Encore time and again tries to bring back to life. There is a workshop dedicated to its teaching for the first years. We have also put up a gold winning production at Inter IIT Cultural '19.</p>

	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p>Did you know, that an actor's 'role' is called so because in the ancient days, they got the script on scrolls?<br> 

		Are we talking about the ancient days now? Yes, and believe you me, it is interesting. <br>
		
		We've all heard of theatre companies advertising their best men by calling them Thespians. They're actually pedestalled upto the level of Thespis, the first guy to act, EVER. (Not counting the series of lies we fabricate every day as acting, mind you.) <br>
		
		Acting was largely a male dominated profession with young boys playing the roles of women, much to their own elation, surprisingly. Europeans have always been a bit weird. <br>
		
		The profession was not always looked at in a very positive light, in fact, they didn't earn a lot of social acceptance until the 19th century (which is still evident in some quintessential indian households even today, sadly.) <br>
		
		However, eventually Shakespeare arrived, and actors started having managers, people started looking upto actors because if William Shakespeare was working with them, then the public at least owed it to that long a name and his acceptance, right? <br>
		
		Acting then, developed with schools of drama propping up over the world, theatre companies opening up, people vying for the profession, and it gradually even managed to seep into universities in the form of a professional course! Nowadays, there are 4 types of acting, yes, it is that serious a skill. <br>
		
		It's not everyone's piece of cake, learning stage technicalities, ways to fight (really, WAYS to fight on stage) so that it doesn't look shabby, and the basic commands coming from your director, who makes or breaks you and your production. <br>
		
		Encore, as a society teaches you about ALL of these forms, and how to act in each one of them. They're different, mind you. Stage plays require a lot of voice modulation, while street plays require loudness, pantomimes require an overtly expressive face, while monologues require you to embody the piece you'll be performing. Along with these of course, you'll always have a society abounding with free and quality advice, for your life in college, as well as on ahead!
